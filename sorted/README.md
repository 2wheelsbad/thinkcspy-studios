# Studio: Sorted

## Concepts Used

- Iterating through a string
- Indexing into a string

## Walkthrough

Write a function ``remove_char`` that takes two string arguments, ``a_str`` and ``a_char``. The first argument should be a string and the second should be a character (i.e. a string of length one). The function should return a new string, the result of which is ``a_str`` with each instance of ``a_char`` removed.

## Studio

Since a string is just a sequence of characters, they can be sorted from least to greatest. Sorting can be hard so we're just going to check if a string is sorted. Write a function which returns a boolean indicating if the string is sorted or not.
