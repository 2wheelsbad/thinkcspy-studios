Below are the answers:
    - Exercise 0:
        - the variable `i` is used twice. Change the loop variable (and the associated print statement) to something else.
        
    - Exercise 1:
        - the function returns `True` while iterating. So if the first person in the list is old enough to enter the bar, the function will eroneously return `True` immediately, even though subsequent people might bee too young.
        
    - Exercise 2:
        - the `else` is followed by a condition, so it should be an `elif`.
