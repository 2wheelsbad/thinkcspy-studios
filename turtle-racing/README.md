# Studio: Turtle Racing

## Concepts Used

- Using modules. Specifically, the `turtles` and `random` modules.
- Iteracting with a module's API at a naive level, where you are calling its functions and making instances of its classes without yet having actually learned explicitly about functions and classes.
- Using a for loop.
- Various solutions to a single problem.

## Walkthrough

Make two turtles trace wobbly paths as if staggering around drunk.
