# Studio: Searching

## Concepts Used

- Conditionals 
- Booleans

## Walkthrough

Write a function which accepts a list of booleans, and answers the question "Are any of these items True?".

Here is a [video of a previous class](https://youtu.be/SC3cMU9AONI)

## Studio

Write a function that takes two arguments: a list of numbers (either floats or integers, or mixed), along with a single number. The function should return True if the number is in the list, and False otherwise.

If you solve that problem with time to spare, modify your function so that it takes the same arguments, but returns the number of times that the number appears in the list.
