## Walkthrough

Write a "gradebook" program that takes grade data for a student and prints the resulting GPA. The output should look something like this:

```
Your grade (0.0-4.0): 4
# credits: 3
Enter another grade? [y/n]: y
Your grade (0.0-4.0): 4
# credits: 2
Enter another grade? [y/n]: n
Your GPA is: 4.0
```

To calculate the GPA you'll need the idea of a *quality score*. A quality score is the number of credits for the class multiplied by the point score. For example, if you get a B (3.0) in a class worth 3 credits, the quality score is 9.0. The GPA for a student is the sum of the quality scores divided by the total number of credits.

This should be written locally in a code editor, and run at the command line. Look at the solution code, and feel free to alter the approach, as there are different methods to achiveing this goal.
